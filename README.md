# Technical Assignment

## Overview

#### Timeframe

The assignment should take around 4 hours. You’re welcome to take as much time as you want,
but don’t feel obliged to finish it if you’re not able to complete it within the timeframe.
Approach
The aim of this assignment is to evaluate the basic technical competence you’ll require for this
position.

- For the frontend implementation you need to use React or an equivalent library.
- Feel free to make use of your preferred styling approach (regular CSS, CSS-in-JS, Sass
  etc.), but do ensure that you make use of custom styles.
- There’s no need to create a fake backend for the data, you can just copy-paste the JSON
  data and import it directly.
- Your work must be your own, and should be completed unassisted. Feel free, though, to
  search the internet to look up any content.
- Communicate your thinking as much as possible. Add a README to communicate how to
  run your solutions and any relevant notes, for example, any extra thoughts on the tasks or
  how you structured your submissions.
- If you are stuck or are taking too much time, use your discretion to implement what is
  important to the task at hand, and write out your challenges in the README.
  Background
  On the OfferZen platform, companies reach out to candidates directly with upfront salary
  expectations. We call this an interview request. A single company can have a few staff members

who send the first interview request and they can reach out to many candidates (developers who
are currently looking for a job) across many roles that company may be hiring for.
In the tasks that follow, you’ll be implementing designs that staff members at a company use to
manage and attend to interview requests.

Tasks
The following exercise involves creating a new single page app (SPA) in order to implement the
provided UI designs and functional requirements.
Files

- Designs – the UI designs on a Figma board
- Data – JSON array containing the test interview request data
  Task A: Basic UI
- Create a SPA in React
- Implement the UI designs as shown in Figure 1
- Use the data from the interviewRequests.json file to render the view

Figure 1

Task B: Searching

- Add a filter bar as shown in Figure 2
- The search filter should allow you to search by candidate name

Task C: Archiving

- Add a column for the actions as shown in Figure 3
- You should be able to archive and unarchive an interview request with the button in the
  action column
- Toggling the Show archived checkbox should show/hide archived interviews

Task D: Questions

- How long did this assignment take you and where did you spend your time?
- What would you do differently or improve in your solution?
- Do you have any feedback on this assignment? For example: What did you enjoy? What
  could be better? Which aspects were unclear?
